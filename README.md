# Detection-of-Dyslexia-using-Handwriting-Images

# Problem Statement :  
  Dyslexia poses significant challenges for individuals, impacting their ability to recognize words accurately 
  and fluently, as well as their spelling and decoding skills. Detecting dyslexia early is essential for effective 
  management and reducing its impact on academic and social growth. However, traditional screening 
  methods often demand specialized assessments and expertise, consuming valuable time and resources. 
  To address this, our project aims to create an efficient system that identifies dyslexia by analyzing 
  handwriting samples. Handwriting analysis offers a promising avenue for detection, as dyslexia can 
  manifest in distinct patterns within writing. By leveraging technology to automate this process, we aim 
  to streamline dyslexia identification, enabling quicker interventions and support for those affected. 
  Ultimately, our goal is to develop a robust and accessible tool that enhances dyslexia detection in a cost
  effective and time-efficient manner. By focusing on handwriting characteristics, we seek to provide 
  educators and healthcare professionals with a valuable resource for early intervention, ultimately 
  improving outcomes for individuals with dyslexia.

# Conclusion 
  In our study on dyslexia detection, we evaluated three classifiers—Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)—using feature sets derived from both images and text. The results highlight the superior performance of classifiers trained on image-based features, with the ANN achieving the highest accuracy at 0.91. This underscores the importance of features like pressure, zonal, and GLCM in detecting dyslexia. The Decision Tree also performed well with image-derived features, achieving an accuracy of 0.875. Although the SVC showed competency with text-based features, its accuracy was lower at 0.85. These findings indicate that combining image-based and text-based features could further enhance dyslexia detection algorithms.
